# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This simple game that is familiar to nearly every child in the world originated in ancient China and Japan around 200 BC. In the early version of the game, the thumb represented the "Frog", little finger was the "Slug", and the index finger - the "Snake" (see The Official History of Rock Paper Scissors and Rock, Paper, Scissors Goes Back To Ancient China). The modern westernized version of the game that is known globally uses Rock, Paper, and Scissors. And the rules are the following:

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Scissors

This exercise consists of implementing the rock paper scissor game. For this, you will need to have a class named `RockPaperScissors`. For playing the game, the user needs to use the class like this:

```st
game := RockPaperScissors new.
result := game play: #paper against: #rock.
result "#paper"
```
