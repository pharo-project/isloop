      <h1><span style="color: var(--color-dark-gray)">isLoop 2024 Venue:</span> Montpellier, France</h1>

      <p>On 5-9 August 2024, the isLoop summer school will be held in
        Montpellier, a city in southern France, near the Mediterranean Sea.
        Established in 1220, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest
        universities in the world and has the oldest medical school still in
        operation. Above the medieval city, the ancient citadel of Montpellier
        is a stronghold built in the seventeenth century by Louis XIII of
        France.</p>

        research and international cooperation organization working for the
        sustainable development of tropical and Mediterranean regions.</p>

      <h2>Reaching the Venue</h2>

      <p>You can reach the meeting venue from the city center of Montpellier
        (Place de la Comédie) by taking Tram 1 in the direction of Mosson.</p>

      <p>Then you have two options:</p>
        
      <ol>
        <li>Descend at the station Universités des Sciences et Lettres. Then
          take the bus La Navette (13) and ride it until you reach the Campus
          Agropolis stop.</li>
        <li>Descend at the station Occitanie and take either bus 23 or bus 26
          to reach the station, Vincent Auriol.</li>
      </ol> 

    <p>See the instructions below on how to buy tickets for public transport
      in Montpellier.</p>

    <h2>Reaching Montpellier</h2>

    <p>You can reach Montpellier either by flying directly to Montpellier
      airport or one of the two larger airports in Toulouse and
      Marseille.</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Montpellier-Méditerranée Airport (MPL)</h3>

    <p>To reach the city center of Montpellier from the airport
      (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gk9PcksAkGNQrGKn7" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Place de la Comédie</a>),
      take bus 620 which stops right in front of the airport. This bus will
      take you to Place de l’Europe where you can take Tram 1 in the direction
      of Mosson. Ride 3 stops on the tram and arrive at
      Place de la Comédie.</p>

    <p>Bus 620 does not belong to the city network of Montpellier.
      The single-ride ticket costs 2 euros. You can buy it from the bus
      driver (they only accept cash) or through an application:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.airweb.occitanie"

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>See the section below for the instructions on how to buy tickets for
      public transport in Montpellier.</p>

    <h3>Toulouse-Blagnac Airport (TLS)</h3>

    <p>To reach Montpellier from the airport of Toulouse, you must first take
      the airport shuttle bus that would take you from the airport to
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/zUh3h4rxFU73Cy3g6" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Toulouse Matabiau</a> - the central train station.
      The shuttle should cost around 10 euros.</p>

    <p>Then you can take a train from Toulouse Matabiau to Montpellier Gare
      Saint-Roch - République, the central train station of Montpellier which
      is 5 min away from Place de la Comédie. Use
      <a href="https://www.sncf-connect.com/en-en/" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">this website</a>
      to purchase the train tickets. You can also use the smartphone app:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsct.vsc.mobile.horaireetresa.android"
          target="_blank"

        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Marseille Provence Airport (MRS)</h3>

    <p>To reach Montpellier from the airport of Marseille, you can take a
      Flixbus. It stops right in front of the airport. The travel duration
      should be around 2 hours. You will arrive at Sabines bus station in
      Montpellier. From there, you will need to take Tram 2 to reach the
      city center (Place de la Comédie).</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you could take the airport shuttle (bus L091) to the
      central train station of Marseille and then travel to Montpellier
      Gare Saint-Roch by train. The airport shuttle leaves every 10 min but
      it takes 45 min to get to the train station.</p>

    <h2>Public Transport in Montpellier: Tickets for trams and buses</h2>

    <p>You might have heard that since December 2023, all public transport in
      Montpellier is free. Be careful because this only concerns people who
      live in Montpellier. Tourists and visitors still have to buy transport
      tickets. Although there is no ticket controll at the doors, from time to
      time, the TaM inspectors enter the transport and check everyone's tickets.
      If you are caught without a ticket, you will have to pay the fine of
      50 EUR.</p>

    <p>You can buy a ticket for public transport in the ticket machines that can
      be found on many tram stops. A single ticket costs 1.6 EUR. You can also
      buy a bundle of 10 tickets for 10 EUR. Be careful because there are no
      ticket machines near our venue, so you will have to buy them in advance.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, you can use the M'Ticket application to buy and validate
      tickets for public transport in Montpellier:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tam_way.mobiletickets"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          M'Ticket for Android
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/mticket-ticket-mobile-tam/id1454637089"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
        >
          M'Ticket for iOS
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful because there are no ticket machines near our venue, so you 
      will either have to use the app or buy your tickets in advance near the
      city center.</p>

    <p>If you decide to go to the seaside, you should know that the closest you
      can get by public transport of Montpellier is the last stop of Tram 3:
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/MQD11Pvu8okNHhdRA" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Pérols - Étang de L'Or</a>. From there, you can either 
      walk for 30 min, take a city bike that are available at the tram stop, or
      use the public transport of Pérols. The network is called
      <a href="https://paysdelor.fr/vivre-ici/transports/bus/" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Transp'Or</a>. The single trip costs 1 EUR and you have to
      pay directly to the driver who only accepts cash. If you take the bus,
      I suggest that you take 
      <a href="https://paysdelor.fr/vivre-ici/transports/bus/ligne-1/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">Line 1 and go to Palavas-les-Flots</a>.
      If you decide to walk, you should go to
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dbsBd5K1h38rE83C7" target="_blank"
      rel="noopener">Carnon Plage</a>.</p>
